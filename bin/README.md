### How to setup project for development
1. Have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed and its required environment variables added to PATH.<br/>**Note:** Maven requires [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to operate, so make sure it is also installed, JDK 17 (64-bit) or higher is preferred.
2. Pull this repository to local machine.
3. `cd` to root folder of the pulled repository.
4. Run `mvn package` to get all required dependencies and build the project.
5. Continue your work.
6. When pushing your commits, remember to create your own branch and do it via **PULL REQUESTS**.<br/>**Warning: Do not commit directly to `master` branch!**
